# DeFault Classification

Run the Jupyter Notebook to parse the data and train a classifier on it.

The purpose of this application is to use accelerometer and barometer sensor
data in order to train a classifier that can detect different
swing types in tennis (Forehand, Backhand, Overhead).

Additionally, the classifier is trained to detect inconsistent
swings and to classify each swing as "Good" or "Bad", as well as
what type of swing it is.
